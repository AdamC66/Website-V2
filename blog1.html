        <h1>Keeping Busy and Learning From Your Mistakes</h1>
        <p>
            I thought I might be a little overdue to add something to the blog section here. Hopefully one post is enough to get the ball rolling and I'll continute to do so.
            I wanted to write a little bit about something that's been on my mind lately, and if the title didnt give it away, it's about keeping busy after bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, obviously there's no one answer for anything, this is just what's been going through my head lately. 
            I have been doing my best to keep programming after bootcamp, I think I've done a pretty good job, but I have been feeling as though I could be doing more.
            One day off here or there isnt a bad thing, it's good to change your focus from time to time and things come up. But when one day turns into two, turns into three and so on, that's where routines begin to change.
            That's when trouble starts
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, I started with a good routine for about 2 weeks post graduation from GA. I did a couple projects, worked on this site, and another one for my hockey team. But after that
            I lost some motivation. It's not that I didn't want to do anything, but more I either didnt know where to start something or didnt want to start something from scratch.
            I would much rather add a feature to an existing project than start something new from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earlier this week I made a solid effort to get back into things, I made myself a development blog using Django, with a full WYSIWYG editor
            (something that was previously a holdup for me making one). I also finally started a project that I've been wanting to do for years, and aim to keep
            working on until it's done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to write too much about this project, but it is a full stack application with a Django backend and a React front end, I'm currently using Django Rest Framework
            to send data between the front and back end, but I'm thinking I may change that up and see if I can use GraphQL. This project also takes me nicely into the second topic I wanted to write about. Learning from your mistakes
        </p>

        <p>
            Especially in programming, but also in life in general, I often do things and thing "I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but I dont know it or cant think of it right now so I'm just going to do it my way."
            That attitude, in my opinion, is totally fine to a certain extent. I'm going to compare my Career Flash project to this new project quickly.
            In Career Flash development, we came across this a lot, it was our first time developing a full stack application, there was lots we didnt know and
            simple things took a long time. "There's got to be a better way" was something I thought a lot during this project. Now starting a new project, it's time to find a better way.
            there were plenty of things in Career Flash that I knew we'd have to go back and fix, but in the timeline we had it was more important to get something working, than to get something working perfectly.
            With a personal project, there is no timeline, so what better time to review the things I didnt like, or didnt think were the best and learn how to do them better.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that's what I've been doing, as I've developed this new project I continuously reference my Career Flash code, and either just review things, or actually write down things that I did that I dont like. So when 
            I have some down time I can research and learn how to do them better. Another reason always having a notebook handy is super useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that covers things pretty well. Try to keep busy, if youre hung up on starting a project, just start it, there's no better time than now. And always review and make note of your mistakes.
            Making a mistake once is fine, even twice, but doing the "wrong" thing over and over again is terrible. Always, always strive to learn and do things better. And always remember the ABCs... Always Be Coding.
